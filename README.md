### My Unraid Docker User Templates for Docspell  

Attention: this is a personal setup and it will not run "out of the box" on your machine..... 

Docspell:
- https://hub.docker.com/r/eikek0/docspell/  
- https://github.com/eikek/docspell
- https://docspell.org/docs/

be carefull, you MUST change some details to get docspell up and running!
- docker: the templates cannot be used as provided, adjust settings!
- files: the files ".env" and "opt/docspell.conf" cannot be used as provided, adjust settings!
- files: copy the files ".env" and "opt/docspell.conf" to appdata/docspell before starting the containers
- docker: change settings of each app appropriate to your configuration
